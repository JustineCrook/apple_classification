# apple_classification
hello again
A tutorial-based hackathon aims to classify bruised `B` from sound `S` apples using mache learning and feature reduction tools. In total, there are four tutorials, which can be listed as follows:
  1. [Data cleaning & visualization](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial1.ipynb)
  2. [Baseline Calculation](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial2.ipynb)
  3. [Feature Engineering and Selection](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial3.ipynb)
  4. [Machine learning classification](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial4.ipynb)

### Not at the hackathon, but want to test your code-building skills? Feel free!

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification.git
```

Then make sure you have the right Python libraries for the tutorials. They can all be installed using pip and the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification/blob/main/requirements.txt) file in the repo:

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### New to Github?

The easiest way to get all of the lecture and tutorial material is to clone this repository. To do this you need git installed on your laptop. If you're working on Linux you can install git using apt-get (you might need to use sudo):

```
apt install git
```

You can then clone the repository by typing:

```
git clone https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification.git
```

To update your clone if changes are made, use:

```
cd apple_classification/
git pull
```
