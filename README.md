# apple_classification

A tutorial-based hackathon aims to classify bruised `B` from sound `S` apples using mache learning and feature reduction tools. In total, there are four tutorials, which can be listed as follows:
  1. [Data cleaning & visualization](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial1.ipynb)
  2. [Baseline Calculation](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial2.ipynb)
  3. [Feature Engineering and Selection](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial3.ipynb)
  4. [Machine learning classification](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial4.ipynb)

### Not at the hackathon, but want to test your code-building skills? Feel free!

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification.git
```

Then make sure you have the right Python libraries for the tutorials. They can all be installed using pip and the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/apple_classification/blob/main/requirements.txt) file in the repo:

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
